## Required Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6+
- Required Python packages (install from requirements.txt):
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Service Key Configuration
- **Service Key**: Create at https://windsurf.com/team/settings
  - Go to Service Key Configuration ‚Üí Configure ‚Üí Add service key
  - Use Role: admin OR create a custom role with read-only access:

    - Grant the new role the "Analytics Read" permissions

### Environment Setup
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```
SERVICE_KEY=your_key_here
```

2. The `output` directory will be automatically created to store all generated files:
   - All scripts save their output files to this directory by default
   - The directory is git-ignored to prevent accidental commits of data files
   - You can override output locations with command-line arguments if needed
